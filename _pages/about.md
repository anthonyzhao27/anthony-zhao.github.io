I'm an undergrad at the Unversity of Toronto pursuing a double major in CS and Statistics with a focus in AI. This past summer, I was an intern at TCL Research America (http://www.tcl-america.com/).

My research interest is utilizing artificial intelligence to create solutions, and I hope to explore that by engaging in research in the fall.

Outside of school and CS, I have been singing for 13 years, and am currently part of Surround Sound, a competitive a cappella group at the University of Toronto. I am also an avid track athlete.
